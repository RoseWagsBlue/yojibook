LaTeX code for making booklets of Japanese yojijukugo

This is a LaTeX style for make reproducable books of Japanese yojijukugo (四字熟語) (よじじゅくご)
I made the orignal book years ago, but I find many other collections of yojijukugo that would make nice books, so I would like a nice repeatable system.  
The book is set in pages the size of a peice of Letter Paper or A4 paper folded into 8 leaves (16 pages).  The package pdfpages then folds each set of pages into a signature, as will be outlined below.  
Of especialy intrest will be code that automatically pads the number of pages to be divisible by 16.
